"about": "Music-loving locals all know about the Music Box, and it doesn’t take long before expat residents learn of it too. This is a popular concert venue and nightclub that hosts a variety of music, including many up-and-coming Portuguese bands. You can find the entrance underneath the colorful bridge that separates Pink Street’s two sides, across from Pink Wine Point.",

"about": "Across the way from The Music Box is another entrance, this one leading into the stylish Pink Wine Point, a cozy cavern-like bar where you can order wine in addition to a plethora of cocktail combinations. Visit with friends for drinks and live music on the weekends. Unlike The Music Box, Pink Wine Point is the place to go for a relaxing but fun night, in an equally lovely setting.",

"greyPrice": "$",
"about": "At one point or another, every bar-hopper in Lisbon has visited Pensão Amor, at least to see the bold decor, if not for the drinks and socializing. Once a brothel, it comprises different rooms filled with bright decor, cushy seating, unique art, and a dancer’s pole. There is even a ‘library’ filled with erotic books. The back entrance opens to Pink Street, but entering from the front entrance at Rua Alecrim is much more impressive – the front room is decorated from floor to ceiling in bright colors and shocking artwork (the ceiling is even a work of art).",

"greyPrice": "$$",
"about": "Perhaps you have heard of Portugal’s love affair with canned fish; Sol e Pesca is one of those low-key and local restaurants where you will enjoy trying them out. At night, swing by to sit on the terrace and sample a few flavors with friends over some beers or wine. Inside, you may not find it hard to believe that it was once a fish tackle shop, since the walls are still covered in fishing gear.",

The trendy restaurant and bar are welcoming, and there is seating outside too, so you can opt to catch Pink Street’s action, smoke, and/or enjoy the night air. Among their long list of beverages, the champagne is recommended.",

"about": "For a casual night of dancing, Europa is one of the more popular nightclubs in Lisbon. It is also one of the older clubs in the city. Some nights are themed, so don’t be surprised if you visit on 80s night, but the venue also rotates musical genres. It is laid-back but busy – this is one of the clubs in the area that stays open until the sun rises again.",

Try one of their daily specials for €5 (USD$5.80). Despite the location in this trendy part of the city, the 4 Caravelas Cocktail Bar feels more like an intimate neighborhood bar.",
