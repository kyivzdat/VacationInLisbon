"about": "‘The Parody’ is an old-fashioned saloon bar, elegantly decorated with vintage posters and paintings. Opened in the early 1970s, A Paródia used to be an antiques shop, and has long been the haunt of Lisbon’s bohemian crowd. The bar is so-named in a tribute to the work of satirical artist Rafael Bordaro Pinheiro, whose work is displayed across the walls. Specializing in wine and cocktails, this is the great place to pass a relaxing, atmospheric night with friends.",

"greyPrice": "$$",
"about": "At the very least, Pharmaciais one of the boldest concepts for a bar-restaurant around, as it’s like a blown-up Damien Hirst artwork. It is located in a former pharmacy, part of Lisbon’s Museum of Pharmacology, and the owners have gone to great lengths to recreate a clinical, surgical experience at every step. The ornate 19th-century glass cabinets have been filled up with bottles, pill jars and pharmaceutical jugs, and are used to serve food and drink. Meanwhile members of the staff wear the white uniform of clinicians. To add to their quirkiness, there is a lawn in front of the bar, with a select few tables set upon it. Is it a ‘beautiful’ bar? Well, it certainly leaves you pondering.",

"about": "Inside Lisbon’s 18th-century Ludovic Palace, O Solar do Vinho do Porto specializes in Portugal’s most famous drink, port. Running since 1946, this classy bar has recently been refurbished by Portuguese designer Paul Lobo and turned into an ultra-stylish venue—a must for any design junkies. The space itself is a feast for the senses, with rooms colored in soft pastels of green and blue, contrasted with exposed brick and Portugal’s distinctive azulejo tiles. Sleek leather armchairs provide maximum comfort, elegant floor lighting adds to the atmosphere, and cabinets are full to the brim with Portugal’s finest wines.",

"greyPrice": "$$",
"about": "Named in homage to Clint Eastwood’s ‘The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly,’ very little, if anything, about this bar reflects the gritty ‘Wild West’ world of the film. O Bom, O Mau, e O Vilão is a relaxed and charming cocktail bar. A collection of small, idiosyncratic rooms, decorated with paintings and an abundance of armchairs to give it a homely, comfortable feel. There is often live music, and the drinks themselves are taken seriously—they stock 21 types of gin alone.",
